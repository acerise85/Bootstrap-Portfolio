            <!---Paragraph about me-->
                <p>My name is Aimes Cerise and I am from a very small town in Colorado called Leadville. Leadville sits at 10,200 ft and is the highest incorporated city in America. There are about 3,000 people in Leadville, so everyone knows everyone. My family owned a sporting goods store and a bar. I moved to Denver Colorado in my twenties 
                where I ended up meeting my wife. After I met my wife we moved to San Diego for 2 years. 
                <p>Once we ran out of money, we moved back to Colorado but by that time it was 
                as expensive as California. Seeing as how it is crazy cold there and expensive, we decided to move to Arizona. We moved here in 2016 and we love it. We recently bought 
                our house here, which has a huge yard for our 4 dogs. Yes, 4 dogs, we are animal people. My wife and I have been together for a very adventurous 10 years.
